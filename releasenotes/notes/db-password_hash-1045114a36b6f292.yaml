deprecations:
  - |
    The ``password_hash`` parameter in ``openstacklib::db::mysql`` and
    ``openstacklib::db::postgresql`` were deprecated and will be removed in
    a future release. Use the ``password`` parameter instead, so that password
    hash is generated from given user and password in puppet-openstacklib.
upgrade:
  - |
    Now this module requires puppetlabs-postgresql >= 6.4.0 .
