    Add `log_level` parameter to control `LogLevel` for Apache vhost.
    By default, Apache only logs warnings and errors in its errors logfile,
    while request timeouts are logged by `mod_reqtimeout` at LogLevel info.
    Default `log_level` value is not defined, which corresponds to
    the default Apache `LogLevel warn`.
