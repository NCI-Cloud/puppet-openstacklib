    Puppet OpenStack has in this release deprecated Puppet 4 support.
    This older version of Puppet is EOL since October 2018 and will only
    get security fixes. We will continue to support this Puppet version
    for the duration of this release with minimal testing. In the next
    release Puppet 4 support will be removed completely and you should
    move to using Puppet 5 or the newly released Puppet 6.
